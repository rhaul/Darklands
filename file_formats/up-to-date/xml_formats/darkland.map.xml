	<html:p>
	Contains the wilderness map, with everything except for
	the dynamically generated locations
	(all non-cities listed in <html:code>darkland.loc</html:code>).
	</html:p>

	<html:p>
	The map is constructed from tiles contained in two <html:code>.pic</html:code> files:
	"<html:code>mapicons.pic</html:code>" and "<html:code>mapicon2.pic</html:code>".

				<note>
					This data is RLE compressed: each byte represents 1-7 map tiles.
				</note>
				<note>
					The top three bits are the repeat count, 
					and are always at least one (<html:code>001xxxxx</html:code>).
				</note>
				<note>
					The next bit is the palette set:
					<html:code>0</html:code> for "<html:code>mapicons.pic</html:code>",
					<html:code>1</html:code> for "<html:code>mapicon2.pic</html:code>".
				</note>
				<note>
					The four least bits indicate which row the tile comes from in the palette set.
				</note>
				<note>
					Which column the map tile comes from depends on the four diagonally adjacent tiles:
					<html:br />
					the 1's bit comes from the northwest tile's row's 8's bit;
					<html:br />
					the 2's bit comes from the northeast tile's row's 4's bit;
					<html:br />
					the 4's bit comes from the southwest tile's row's 2's bit;
					<html:br />
					the 8's bit comes from the southeast tile's row's 1's bit.
				</note>
				<note>
					W: Described recipe doesn't seem to work.<html:br />
					The bits seems to be set by adjacent tile "similarity". Tile having same palette and row sets the bit. Plus there are other relations: river binds to bridge tile (and vice versa), most of "wet" tiles binds together, etc.
				</note>
				<note>
					Odd lines (y%2 == 1) are shifted by half to the right. Therefore ie. for y==2 are north adjacent tiles coordinates x-1, y-1 and x, y-1, and for y==3 are north adjacent tiles coordinates x, y-1 and x+1, y-1.
