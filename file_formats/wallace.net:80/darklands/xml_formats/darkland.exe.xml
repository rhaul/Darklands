<description type="extended">
	<html:p>
	This is the main executable for Darklands.
	</html:p>
	<html:p>
	Because this is a compiled binary executable, not much of the file
	is comprehensible without disassembling it.
	Still, many of the strings can be found, and quite possibly some
	arrays that indicate game flow logic (ie, movement between cards).
	</html:p>
	<html:p>
	Many of the "arrays of pointers to X" appear to be for a segmented architecture,
	with segment:offset pointers (the high two bytes being the segment).
	Such arrays are simply described as "Segmented pointers, with segment=0x????",
	with the segment translated from big-endian.
	</html:p>
	<html:p>
	Oftentimes, one array contains offsets into a number of semantically different
	string tables; in these cases the string tables will all be listed separately,
	but offsets will always be relative to the first entry of the first table.
	</html:p>
